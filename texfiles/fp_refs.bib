	abstract = {The nitrogen-vacancy center (N-V center) is one of numerous point defects in diamond. Its most explored and useful property is photoluminescence, which can be easily detected from an individual N-V center, especially those in the negative charge state (N-V−). Electron spins at N-V centers, localized at atomic scales, can be manipulated at room temperature by applying a magnetic field, electric field, microwave radiation or light, or a combination, resulting in sharp resonances in the intensity and wavelength of the photoluminescence. These resonances can be explained in terms of electron spin related phenomena such as quantum entanglement, spin-orbit interaction and Rabi oscillations, and analysed using advanced quantum optics theory. An individual N-V center can be viewed as a basic unit of a quantum computer, and it has potential applications in novel, more efficient fields of electronics and computational science including quantum cryptography, spintronics and masers.},

	abstract = {{MAGNETIC} resonance spectroscopy1 is a powerful tool for molecular characterization and structure determination. The sensitivity of conventional approaches is limited to about 1010 electron spins or 1016 nuclear spins; this sensitivity can be improved to about 105 spins by polarizing the spins via optical pumping and detecting optical rather than microwave photons2. Recently, fluorescence from single molecules was detected by tuning a single-frequency laser in the inhomogeneously broadened fluorescence excitation band of a dilute dispersion of pentacene in a host crystal of p-terphenyl3,4. Here we report that, by combining single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy with optically detected magnetic resonance for the pentacene-doped p-terphenyl system, we can detect magnetic resonance in a single pentacene molecule. We observe two of the three possible transitions between sublevels of the metastable triplet state. The spectral lineshapes indicate that the proton nuclear spin states change during the measurement, leading to spectral diffusion within the magnetic resonance line.},

	abstract = {Crystal defects in diamond have emerged as unique objects for a variety of applications, both because they are very stable and because they have interesting optical properties. Embedded in nanocrystals, they can serve, for example, as robust single-photon sources or as ﬂuorescent biomarkers of unlimited photostability and low cytotoxicity. The most fascinating aspect, however, is the ability of some crystal defects, most prominently the nitrogen-vacancy ({NV}) center, to locally detect and measure a number of physical quantities, such as magnetic and electric ﬁelds. This metrology capacity is based on the quantum mechanical interactions of the defect’s spin state. In this review, we introduce the new and rapidly evolving ﬁeld of nanoscale sensing based on single {NV} centers in diamond. We give a concise overview of the basic properties of diamond, from synthesis to electronic and magnetic properties of embedded {NV} centers. We describe in detail how single {NV} centers can be harnessed for nanoscale sensing, including the physical quantities that may be detected, expected sensitivities, and the most common measurement protocols. We conclude by highlighting a number of the diverse and exciting applications that may be enabled by these novel sensors, ranging from measurements of ion concentrations and membrane potentials to nanoscale thermometry and single-spin nuclear magnetic resonance.},

	abstract = {Fluorescent particles are routinely used to probe biological processes. The quantum properties of single spins within fluorescent particles have been explored in the field of nanoscale magnetometry, but not yet in biological environments. Here, we demonstrate optically detected magnetic resonance of individual fluorescent nanodiamond nitrogen-vacancy centres inside living human {HeLa} cells, and measure their location, orientation, spin levels and spin coherence times with nanoscale precision. Quantum coherence was measured through Rabi and spin-echo sequences over long ({\textgreater}10 h) periods, and orientation was tracked with effective 1° angular precision over acquisition times of 89 ms. The quantum spin levels served as fingerprints, allowing individual centres with identical fluorescence to be identified and tracked simultaneously. Furthermore, monitoring decoherence rates in response to changes in the local environment may provide new information about intracellular processes. The experiments reported here demonstrate the viability of controlled single spin probes for nanomagnetometry in biological systems, opening up a host of new possibilities for quantum-based imaging in the life sciences.},

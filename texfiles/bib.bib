	abstract = {The nitrogen-vacancy center (N-V center) is one of numerous point defects in diamond. Its most explored and useful property is photoluminescence, which can be easily detected from an individual N-V center, especially those in the negative charge state (N-V−). Electron spins at N-V centers, localized at atomic scales, can be manipulated at room temperature by applying a magnetic field, electric field, microwave radiation or light, or a combination, resulting in sharp resonances in the intensity and wavelength of the photoluminescence. These resonances can be explained in terms of electron spin related phenomena such as quantum entanglement, spin-orbit interaction and Rabi oscillations, and analysed using advanced quantum optics theory. An individual N-V center can be viewed as a basic unit of a quantum computer, and it has potential applications in novel, more efficient fields of electronics and computational science including quantum cryptography, spintronics and masers.},

	abstract = {{MAGNETIC} resonance spectroscopy1 is a powerful tool for molecular characterization and structure determination. The sensitivity of conventional approaches is limited to about 1010 electron spins or 1016 nuclear spins; this sensitivity can be improved to about 105 spins by polarizing the spins via optical pumping and detecting optical rather than microwave photons2. Recently, fluorescence from single molecules was detected by tuning a single-frequency laser in the inhomogeneously broadened fluorescence excitation band of a dilute dispersion of pentacene in a host crystal of p-terphenyl3,4. Here we report that, by combining single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy with optically detected magnetic resonance for the pentacene-doped p-terphenyl system, we can detect magnetic resonance in a single pentacene molecule. We observe two of the three possible transitions between sublevels of the metastable triplet state. The spectral lineshapes indicate that the proton nuclear spin states change during the measurement, leading to spectral diffusion within the magnetic resonance line.},

	abstract = {Crystal defects in diamond have emerged as unique objects for a variety of applications, both because they are very stable and because they have interesting optical properties. Embedded in nanocrystals, they can serve, for example, as robust single-photon sources or as ﬂuorescent biomarkers of unlimited photostability and low cytotoxicity. The most fascinating aspect, however, is the ability of some crystal defects, most prominently the nitrogen-vacancy ({NV}) center, to locally detect and measure a number of physical quantities, such as magnetic and electric ﬁelds. This metrology capacity is based on the quantum mechanical interactions of the defect’s spin state. In this review, we introduce the new and rapidly evolving ﬁeld of nanoscale sensing based on single {NV} centers in diamond. We give a concise overview of the basic properties of diamond, from synthesis to electronic and magnetic properties of embedded {NV} centers. We describe in detail how single {NV} centers can be harnessed for nanoscale sensing, including the physical quantities that may be detected, expected sensitivities, and the most common measurement protocols. We conclude by highlighting a number of the diverse and exciting applications that may be enabled by these novel sensors, ranging from measurements of ion concentrations and membrane potentials to nanoscale thermometry and single-spin nuclear magnetic resonance.},

Quantum coherence was measured through Rabi and spin-echo sequences over long ({\textgreater}10 h) periods, and orientation was tracked with effective 1° angular precision over acquisition times of 89 ms. The quantum spin levels served as fingerprints, allowing individual centres with identical fluorescence to be identified and tracked simultaneously. Furthermore, monitoring decoherence rates in response to changes in the local environment may provide new information about intracellular processes. The experiments reported here demonstrate the viability of controlled single spin probes for nanomagnetometry in biological systems, opening up a host of new possibilities for quantum-based imaging in the life sciences.},

For example, probing temperature on the nanoscale with high precision can potentially be used to detect small, local temperature changes like those caused by chemical reactions or biochemical processes. However, precise nanoscale temperature measurements have not been realized so far owing to the lack of adequate probes. Here we experimentally demonstrate a novel nanoscale temperature sensing technique based on optically detected electron spin resonance in single atomic defects in diamonds. These diamond sensor sizes range from a micrometer down to a few tens of nanometers. We achieve a temperature noise floor of 5 {mK}/Hz1/2 for single defects in bulk sensors. Using doped nanodiamonds as sensors the temperature noise floor is 130 {mK}/Hz1/2 and accuracies down to 1 {mK} for nanocrystal sizes and therefore length scales of a few tens of nanometers. This combination of precision and position resolution, combined with the outstanding sensor photostability, should allow the measurement of the heat produced by chemical interactions involving a few or single molecules even in heterogeneous environments like cells.},

Here we demonstrate magnetic imaging of living cells (magnetotactic bacteria) under ambient laboratory conditions and with sub-cellular spatial resolution (400 nanometres), using an optically detected magnetic field imaging array consisting of a nanometre-scale layer of nitrogen–vacancy colour centres implanted at the surface of a diamond chip. With the bacteria placed on the diamond surface, we optically probe the nitrogen–vacancy quantum spin states and rapidly reconstruct images of the vector components of the magnetic field created by chains of magnetic nanoparticles (magnetosomes) produced in the bacteria. We also spatially correlate these magnetic field maps with optical images acquired in the same apparatus. Wide-field microscopy allows parallel optical and magnetic imaging of multiple cells in a population with submicrometre resolution and a field of view in excess of 100 micrometres. Scanning electron microscope images of the bacteria confirm that the correlated optical and magnetic images can be used to locate and characterize the magnetosomes in each bacterium. Our results provide a new capability for imaging bio-magnetic structures in living cells under ambient conditions with high spatial resolution, and will enable the mapping of a wide range of magnetic signals within cells and cellular networks5,6.},

	abstract = {In this paper we investigate at room temperature the excited state lifetime of single {NV}-/{NV}0 in nanodiamonds at a variety of excitation wavelengths from 510 to 570 nm. The average lifetimes of 25 nanodiamonds with similar sizes exhibit constant values over the entire investigated spectral window. We conclude that the variation observed can be attributed to the specific nanodiamonds. Therefore it is sample dependent, rather than related to the photo-physical properties of the defects. Our study is relevant for the potential use of nanodiamonds containing {NV} in application where the lifetime is used for sensing the local nano-environment.},

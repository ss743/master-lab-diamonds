\section{Introduction}

Diamonds are not just known and appreciated by their beauty but also for it important technical properties like their mechanical hardness which they mainly get from their crystal structure \ref{jelezko_single_2006}. Nevertheless there are defects in their lattice structure which enable us to use diamonds more variously. Colour centres, for example, are fluorescent lattice defects which can be used for many sensing applications \cite{anleitung}. In this experiment we will examine the properties of the so-called nitrogen vacancy (NV) centre and it's sensitivity to magnetic fields.\\

Colour centres (CC) are  regular spacing in the lattice that absorbs a particular colour in light. This not just gives a special colour to the diamond but also relates to more interesting properties like fluorescence. where the lattice atoms gets lifted into an excited state and then decaying back into the ground state by emitting a photon with a wavelength in the visible range. The fluorescence here examined are the NV-centres that can be used to detect magnetic fields giving place to Optical Detection Magneto resonance or ODMR.\\

ODMR is done using the measurement method in which the NV-centres are excited by microwaves which leads to a loss in fluorescence at a certain microwave frequency. The recorded frequency spectrum in a frequency range around that frequency depends on the external magnetic field.\\

Also the fluorescence spectrum of the diamond as well as its size will be measured using an optical spectrometer and a CCD camera.

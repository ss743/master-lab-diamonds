\section*{Abstract}
ptical detection of electron spin resonances of nitrogen-vacancy
(NV) centers in diamond [14, 15, 42].  This system offers the possibility to detect
magnetic fields with an unprecedented combination of spatial resolution and magnetic
sensitivity [43, 41, 13, 42, 44], in a wide range of temperatures (from 0 K to well
above 300 K), opening up new frontiers in biological [14, 45, 46] and condensed-
matter [14, 47, 48] research.  Over the last few years, researchers have developed
techniques for scanning magnetometry using nanoscale imaging techniques in bulk
diamond [15, 42, 49], as well as in nanodiamonds [50, 51, 52] combined with scanning
probe techniques [14, 53]. Sensors employing ensembles of NV centers promise even
higher sensitivity and the possibility to map out all vector components of the magnetic
field [13, 12], and pilot NV-ensemble magnetometers have recently been demonstrated
by several groups [48, 47, 54, 44]

\subsection{Calibration}
\subsubsection{convertion factor camera}
The strip was meassure with a calibrator at 1.2\pm 0.1 $mm$ and the camara used was a Thorlabs CCd camera with dimentions of 1280X1024 pixels, ecah pixel with 5.2X5.2 $\mu m$ acording to the manufacturer.
In order to know the actual resolution of our microscope a calibration was done based on the magnification and calibration factor of the set up.
Theoritically our C_{f} can be calculated as:

\begin{equation}
C_{f}=\dfrac{1 Pixel * M/}{d_{p}} = 1552 px/mm
\end{equation}\\
Where M is the magnification and d_{p} is the pixel sizes. And with a Magnificatio icual to the lenses used for the confocal setup is equal to the magniﬁcation $M=f2/f1=8X$.
In this case the tool of Thorlab’s software was used to determine and measure the width of the microstrip. Using the equation above and the respective measumente we denote that  C_{f} =1346 px/mm, with a magnification factor close to 7X.

\subsection{Calibration}
\subsubsection{convertion factor camera}
The strip was meassure with a calibrator at $1.2\pm 0.1\,\mathrm{mm}$ and the camara used was a Thorlabs CCD camera with dimentions of 1280x1024 pixels, each pixel with $5.2\times5.2 \mathrm{\mu m}$ according to the manufacturer.
In order to know the actual resolution of our microscope a calibration was done based on the magnification and calibration factor of the set up.
Theoritically our $C_{f}$ can be calculated as:

\begin{equation}
C_{f}=\dfrac{1 px \cdot M}{d_{p}} = 1552 px/mm
\end{equation}\\
Where $M$ is the magnification and $d_{p}$ is the pixel sizes. And with a Magnification icual to the lenses used for the confocal setup is equal to the magnification $M=f2/f1=8$.
In this case the tool of Thorlabâ€™s software was used to determine and measure the width of the microstrip. Using the equation above and the respective measumente we denote that  $C_{f} =1346 \,\mathrm{px/mm}$, with a magnification factor close to $M=7$.

\section{Theoretical Background}
In the following some physical concepts needed for the understanding of this experiment are explained.
%\subsection{Physical Concepts}
\subsection{Colour Centres}
Colour centres are a kind of point defects in crystal structures which contain a electron that absorbs light of certain wavelengths. This creates a colour in the crystal and therfore these defects are called colour centres.
